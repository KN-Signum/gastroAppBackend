# Problem Statement

Tracking gastrological issues effectively is a challenge for patients suffering from such conditions.

## Justification

- Physicians at Borowska Hospital in Wrocław identified a gap in tracking gastrological disorders. In response, KN Signum, led by Professor Kraszewski, collaborated with the hospital to initiate this project aimed at developing a solution.

## Proposed Solution

- We proposed the development of a software application specifically designed to address the problem of tracking gastrological issues.

## Key Functionalities

To ensure the software meets real-world needs, we gathered input directly from both patients and physicians. Based on their feedback, we defined the following functionalities:

### For Patients

- Ability to log and track illness episodes.
- Option to record and monitor medication usage.
- Tools to manage and track upcoming doctor appointments.
- Notifications reminding patients to take prescribed medications.

### For Physicians

- Ability to monitor patients’ illness events.
- Functionality to track patients' medication adherence.
- Tools to manage and track patient appointments.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- The solution is innovative, offering a proactive approach to managing gastrological disorders, with no direct competition in terms of similar applications in the market.

### Weakneses

- Patients or physicians might be resistant to adopting new technology or may prefer traditional methods of tracking health information.

- data privacy and security

### Opportunities

- Due to the absence of similar applications, there is a unique opportunity to pioneer this technology.

### Threats

- Patients may not consistently log data or follow notifications, reducing the effectiveness of the application for both patients and physicians.
